**Creating Resume or Displaying a resume on a GitHub Repository**

This is your README file for this project. This describes how the html code is done.

This html code contains a <title> tag where the title "Resume" is given. Then using the <object> tag, we embed a link onto the html code.
The code is run using the inbuilt terminal or in chrome and the result is displayed.
